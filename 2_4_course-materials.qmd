## PSYC BC1101 Materials

I set up my R assignments as a posit.cloud project:

I also have a version with my suggested solutions which I share with TAs:

I organize the rest of my course materials (lectures etc) as a Quarto website with a mix of text web pages and presentation slides.

Lastly, I put together some interactive stats visualization and games here as a Quarto website (though the interactive elements mostly use javascript rather than R code)

## Labs

## Social lab materials

My Social lab manual, which walks students through 3 R coding projects, is prepared as a Quarto Book:

In conjunction with that, I have a posit.cloud Project for students containing the required data files for analysis and report templates.
