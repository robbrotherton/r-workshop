# Introduction to R and RStudio

You will use posit.cloud to access problem sets as Quarto documents, using RStudio to write R code and answer questions. You'll just need to [sign up for a free account](https://login.posit.cloud/register).

I'll make the problem sets available in due course.

### Wait, what are you talking about?

There are a few different names involved here, so to try and clear things up:

-   **R** is a coding language for statistics and data analysis
-   **RStudio** is a software interface for using R
-   **Posit** is the name of the company that makes RStudio
-   **posit.cloud** provides a way of using RStudio in your web browser
-   **Quarto** is a document format which allows for code and text to be combined and nicely formatted as html webpages or pdf documents (or both!)

You can install R/RStudio/Quarto on your own computer for free and do things that way, but using posit.cloud simplifies things immensely.

## The general workflow

R is a programming language well-suited to interactive data exploration and analysis. It is widely used for psychological research, which is why we'll use it as our tool for learning and applying the statistical techniques covered in the lectures.

It might seem daunting if you've have no experience with coding, but the basic idea is that you have some data, like you are familiar with from a regular Excel or Google Sheets spreadsheet, and you perform operations on your data using functions a lot like you would in Excel/Sheets. For example, you might compute an average in Sheets by typing `=AVERAGE(A1:A10)`. In R you might type `mean(my_data$column_a)`. The specifics of the function names are different, but the basic idea is the same.

### RStudio

RStudio is the interface we'll use to write and run R code and see its output. The basic interface has 4 panels, each with a few tabs:

-   Top-left: Code editor / data viewer
    -   You will edit your problem set document here
    -   You can run code within code chunks by clicking on a line of code and pressing `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` on your keyboard, or pressing the green "play" button at the top of the chunk
-   Bottom-left: R console
    -   You can type code directly and run it by pressing enter.
    -   You won't be saving your code as a document like when you type in in the editor, so this is useful for testing something simple out
-   Top-right: Environment
    -   As you execute code you may be creating objects like sets of numbers of data.frames. Those objects will appear here.
    -   You can click the name of some objects, like data.frames, and it will open a view of the data as a tab in the editor pane
-   Bottom-right: Files/folders, Plots, Viewer, help window
    -   You can navigate the file tree, and when you "Render" your document you will see how it looks as a fully-formatted web page.

Once you start working on problem sets, my recommended workflow is to "Render" your document frequently with "Preview in Viewer Pane" selected. That will give you something like this:

You'll have the editable problem set `.qmd` open on the left, and an expanded preview of the rendered document on the right. That should make it easy to see questions and instructions on the right, and add your own code solutions and text on the left, re-rendering as you make changes to see your work reflected in the preview on the right.
