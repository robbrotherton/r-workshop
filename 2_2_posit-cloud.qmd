## Names

[There are a few different names involved:]{.content-hidden when-format="revealjs"}

-   **R** is a coding language for statistics and data analysis
-   **RStudio** is a software interface for writing and running R code
-   **Posit** is the name of the company that makes RStudio
-   **posit.cloud** provides a way of using RStudio in your web browser

As we've seen, you can install R and RStudio on your own computer for free and do things that way, but using posit.cloud simplifies things immensely when it comes to building R into a course.

## Differences between cloud vs local

## Assignments

Packages installed in your source version will be already installed in students' copies. Avoids the need for tedious and confusing installation, and occasional errors due to differences across students' hardware/software setups.

Instructor can see all studnets' projects which were derived from the assigment. Can click into students' project and see their work, debug, etc.
