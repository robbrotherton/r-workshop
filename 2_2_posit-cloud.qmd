## Differences between cloud vs local

Each cloud 'Project' is its own unique system. Additional packages installed in one project will not be.

### Cost

No cost to students. Potentially cost to instructor/department

#### Tiers

Free:

$15/month instructor account.


## Assignments

Packages installed in your source version will be already installed in students' copies. Avoids the need for tedious and confusing installation, and occasional errors due to differences across students' hardware/software setups.

Instructor can see all studnets' projects which were derived from the assigment. Can click into students' project and see their work, debug, etc.
