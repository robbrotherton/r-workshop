# Quarto

## What is Quarto?

"**An open-source scientific and technical publishing system"**

Works seamlessly within RStudio

Next generation version of R Markdown.

Provides an integrated workflow: Combines narrative text with code, output and visualizations in a single document, or cohesive collection of documents.

### Output formats

-   Single documents

    -   PDF article

    -   Word document

    -   HTML article

    -   HTML presentation

-   Collection of documents

    -   Book (html and/or PDF)

    -   Website (html pages, navigation)

### Benefits of using Quarto over just R

-   Reproducibility: Ensures that analyses and results can be consistently replicated, fostering transparency in research and teaching.

-   Engaging Teaching Materials: Create interactive documents that combine theoretical explanations with practical code examples.

-   Efficient Assignment Management: Design assignments where students can execute and modify code within the same document, streamlining grading and feedback.

-   Professional Reporting: Generate publication-ready reports and presentations directly from your analyses.

## Working with Quarto documents

## Getting started

### A single document

File \> New File \> Quarto Document

YAML section

``` yaml
---
title: "Untitled"
---
```

Text.

Code chunks.

```{r}
# hello!
```

### Typing text

Source vs Visual

### Code chunks

```{r}
#| label: example chunk
```

### Rendering

Use the "Render" button in RStudio to execute all code and generate the final output. Each render starts from a clean environment, ensuring that all results are reproducible; all code gets executed from scratch.

### A Quarto Project

#### Project Features

The `_quarto.yml` file.

Contains rendering instructions for the entire project, and things that will apply to each file.

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

format:
  html:
    toc: true
```

## Advanced Features

### Citations and References

Manage bibliographies using .bib files.

Insert citations using @citation_key.

Automatically generate reference sections.

### Cross-referencing

Label figures and tables for easy cross-referencing within the text.

An image can be give an ID when inserted, e.g.

```         
![The R Logo](images/r-logo.png){#fig-logo}
```

![The R Logo](images/r-logo.png){#fig-logo}

Typing "`As shown in @fig-logo, R has a perfectly pleasant logo."` becomes:

As shown in @fig-logo, R has a perfectly pleasant logo.
